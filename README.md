# Classic Arcade Game

**Project Details**: With art assets and game engine provided, I implemented the Player and the Enemy classes, using Object-Oriented JavaScript inside the app.js file.

### Run the Game
_In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies._

* Download the Arcade Game file folder from [here](https://github.com/XuqiuyeLi/Udacity_Arcade_Game)
* Open the html file on your browser
* Now you can run the game!


### How to Play

The player can move **left**, **right**, **up** and **down**. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.


##### Enjoy the game!
